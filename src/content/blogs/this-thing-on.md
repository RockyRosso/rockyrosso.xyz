Hello...? Oh...here we go.

Finally finished getting this blogging system set up. God knows how often I'll be using this, but hey, always a good thing to have.

I'm currently using a markdown system for this whole thing using Astro's built in markdown rendering feature. You can see how I did it in the [Github repo](https://github.com/RockyRosso/rockyrosso.xyz) for this website if you're curious on how I implemented it. It probably could've been done a bit better, but I don't care. As long as it works!

I'm going to be using these blogs as kind of mini dev logs for projects I'm going to be working on. And maybe some updates on some surface level life stuff. I don't know right now since I doubt anybody will be reading these anyway. I just kind of want a place to dump stuff which I don't find important enough for social media like twitter or bluesky. Also don't mind the occasional typo or misspelling on some posts as sometimes I just kind of lose myself when writing and tend to overlook them quite easily. My writing style as well might feel a bit off for some people. But that could be just a me thing too. Please do let me know by creating an issue or pull request on the repository if so. Since my current grammar checking tool is Google docs, and I don't know how accurate it is with grammar if at all.

Speaking of bluesky though, I do have one if you have any care to follow me on there, [@rockyrosso.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/rockyrosso.bsky.social). I will probably barely post over there, only posting works of mine which I myself find impressive (which isn't very often). All posts on bluesky though will also be posted to this site as well whether that be through the projects page or as a blog.

Now with this being the first blog post, I guess I'll introduce who I am real quick...

I currently go under the name Rocky Ross as my internet name. I'm primarily a programmer but I'm kind of all over the place with interests at the moment. I‚Äôm kind of stretched between video editing, 3D modeling, game development, and even the occasional animation. Between all of them though, I‚Äôm pretty much a beginner (besides video editing) as my creations have been very subpar to say the least. The interest I‚Äôm feeling strongest in is programming though and that‚Äôs my main career path, with video editing being a back up in a way, but I‚Äôve been looking in both industries. Of course, with both industries being very challenging to get into which is always fun.

The only social media I‚Äôm active on at the moment are Instagram, Discord, and YouTube. I‚Äôve been trying to cut my addiction to Twitter but, I don‚Äôt know why, but it‚Äôs just so interesting to see people make the most mind numbingly dumb takes on the internet. Just something about it keeps making me want to come back and I kind of hate it. Because I swear, anytime I see those damn tweets I lose a few brain cells every time.

But enough about my twitter ramble. Let‚Äôs move onto something that‚Äôs probably slightly more interesting...my projects. ü§©

I‚Äôm currently working on the website, convert4.me. Which also happens to be at the top of the projects list currently. I mean, granted I haven‚Äôt been actively working on it as of late since I keep distracting myself with other short term projects which sound interesting to me at the time. Such as playing around with Minecraft Java to make mods, or Discord bots to do whatever comes to the top of my mind first. Also gaming, of course. I want to get the site fully done as I need to rewrite the backend since it‚Äôs filled to the brim with bugs at the moment, but every time I open the code editor and just look at the code for it, I just tend to gravitate towards that ‚ÄúX‚Äù button and just kind of forget about it. I just kind of feel a mix of being too lazy and also just unmotivated, and I‚Äôm unsure as to why. I‚Äôll get around to it eventually though, as it is one of my most ambitious projects as of late so...we‚Äôll see what happens I guess.

Anyway...if you made it this far in the post, then I applaud you. As it probably wasn‚Äôt easy to read through my sentences of random ramblings and just nothing paragraphs. But I guess you found it somewhat enjoyable I guess. But yeah. As stated in the beginning, I don‚Äôt know how often I‚Äôll be posting to this site or bluesky, but I will attempt to set a goal of at least 3-4 posts on this site. ATLEAST.

Thanks for reading though! Means a lot. :)
